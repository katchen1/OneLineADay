## Synopsis

OneLineADay is a journaling app that offers a unique, in-depth experience by combining the convenience of journaling with the power of NLP analysis and social interaction. Daily push notifications prompt users to log text, photos, or videos which can be revisited and analyzed using NLP methods. Users have the option to connect with friends, engage in meaningful conversations, and track their personal growth over time.


## Executive Summary

Our product is motivated by [One Line a Day: A Five Year Memory Book](https://www.chroniclebooks.com/products/one-line-a-day-a-five-year-memory-book). We seek to not only digitize this experience (overcoming the five-year barrier and allowing for multimedia entries) but also add social aspects and NLP analysis, going beyond what a physical book can provide.

Developed in React Native, the app will be accessible on iOS and Android platforms and feature a clean, user-friendly interface. Daily push notifications will prompt users to log text, photos, or videos. Users can revisit previous entries for a specific day and see patterns emerge over the years as important events like anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays come and go.

OneLineADay will also include advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis to provide users with insights into their thoughts and emotions. NLP methods such as sentiment analysis and named-entity recognition will help users to better understand their experiences and how they’ve changed over time. This feature will be especially useful for users who want to track their personal growth and reflect on their life journey.

While journals are private by default, users can opt in to the social aspect of the app, which allows them to connect with friends, view each others’ journals, like/comment on entries, and engage in meaningful conversations about their experiences.

By combining the convenience of journaling, the power of NLP analysis, and social interaction, OneLineADay will offer a unique, in-depth journaling experience.
